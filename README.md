### Introduction

A simple game written in C++ using SDL2 as a graphic library.
This is my first game for my second semester's project in 2018.
I wrote all my project on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, kernel 4.14.0-041400-generic), this is a Linux version only, so you can't run it on Windows or macOS.

### Install

Just download all my project and double click on `a.out` file to run the game.
Press `Spacebar` for shooting and `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` keys (arrow keys) for moving.

If you want to change any thing in my code, here is the compile command, navigate your folder direction to this folder and paste this command in your terminal:

`g++ *.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf; ./a.out`

You can find this command line in `build.sh` in this folder.
